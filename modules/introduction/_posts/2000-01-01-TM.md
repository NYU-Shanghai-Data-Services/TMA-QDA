#### What is text mining and text analytics?
Text mining, or text analytics, is the **automated** process by which **large volumes** of unstructured, natural‐language text are analysed in order to pinpoint and extract user‐specified information. It is easy for human beings but complex for computer programs.

Broadly speaking, it’s the process by which computers are used to reveal information in and about text (Marti Hearst definition). Computer algorithms can discern patterns in bodies of (often unstructured) text. ”Unstructured” means that little is known about the semantic meaning of the text data and that it does not fit a defined data model or database. An algorithm is simply a computational process that creates an output from an input. In text analysis, the input would be the unstructured text, and the output would be indicators to help you reveal different things about the text. It should be noted that text analysis is more than just search, meaning it’s not just about discovery and knowing something is there. It’s also about exploring what does it mean for something to be there. For instance, knowing the word “creativity” appears in x number of volumes is only the first step; we also want to know what does this tell us. 

Text analysis can be used for a variety of purposes. It can be used for exploratory and analytical research, such as seeking out patterns in scientific literature to pick up trends in medical research otherwise difficult to see from the vantage point of an individual reader. It can also be used in developing tools that we use in our daily lives, for example creating spam filters to identify spam e-mail.
